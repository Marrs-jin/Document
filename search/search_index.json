These folders are located in the same directory that all the Python scripts are saved at. Subdirectories for data used All data folders need to be in the same directory as the codes are. The folders at this level are: Data ElementsHTMLS Experimental_Data Format_csvs OtherData Data stores the energy values and matrix elements used to calculate the transition rates for every element. Specific data for each element are stored in a subdirectory in Data named after the element, for example \"Data/Cs\" ElementsHTMLS is the folder the final HTML files are saved in. Experimental_Data has the manually generated experimental data values for every element. Also included are the reference key files. Format_csvs has the HTML stylings and button lists for the HTML pages. These are split into subdirectories based on the type of page, for example \"MatrixEle\" or \"OtherData\". OtherData has the metastable, hyperfine, and nuclear data for all elements. Also included are the reference key files. Note that metastable states have to be saved in an excel file unique to the element as opposed to a combined file. Data Folder contains nist_urls.csv, which stores the URLs for the NIST page of the element. These URLs are used in the \"ASD\" button on the HTML page. Files are: nist_urls.csv Energies and matrix elements values are stored in folders within the Data folder named after the element in use, i.e. \"Cs\" or \"BaII\". Note: Data/Stylings has the custom styling and functionality for the HTML modals, which is what controls how the Help buttons and Info buttons pop up. However, these files are saved directly in the main directory of the web portal. Modification of how the pop ups look or function should be done on the files directly on the web portal. See \"Uploading to Site\" for information on how to access this directory. -Element subdirectories (\"Data/BaII\") Every element needs its own sub-folder, named in this convention: \"Cs\", \"BaII\", \"Fr\". These are located in \"Data\" as subdirectories. These folders need three files: datapol, rates1, and rates2. Using BaII as an example, the folder should have these files in this naming convention: datapolBaII.txt rates1.txt rates2.txt datapol has the matrix element values, wavelengths, and errors. This is used to calculate transition properties. rates1 has the transition rates, branching ratios, etc. with their errors. This is used in comparison with the Python code to calculate errors to ensure the same result was obtained. rates2 has the lifetimes with errors. This is used in comparison with the Python code to calculate errors to ensure the same result was obtained. Format_csvs These folders store the styling for the various HTML pages. Each type of page (transition rate, matrix element, page with all the transition rates, other data) has its own unique styling. These stylings are stored in separate folders. Stylings are split within a folder. For example, there is an \"intro_formatting\" for most pages that covers the read in of required libraries and any formatting before data tables. There is often styling in-between data tables, which is also saved as a separate txt files. Pages also have an \"End_formatting\" or similar file that controls any javascript functions used and any formatting after all tabular data is saved. The sub-folders these styles are saved in are listed below. Folders are: MatrixEle TransitionRates OtherData Descriptions for these folders are given below. -MatrixEle (\"Format_csvs/MatrixEle\") This houses the formatting for the matrix element HTML pages. Matrix element pages are saved in the format Ra.html, CaII.html. There are four necessary files for matrix element styling. These files are (Using Ra as example): Intro_to_excel_formatting.txt Excel_to_main_formatting.txt End_formatting.txt RaIIMatButtons.txt Intro_to_excel_formatting loads in bootstrap (default styles) libraries, css styles, and function libraries. It also has all the styling before data tables are loaded in, which includes the menu bar and the list of buttons among other things. The Excel_to_main_formatting controls the styling in-between the data table that is downloaded on the \"excel\" button click and the data table that is shown on the portal. End_formatting controls the styling to close the HTML file as well as functions for sorting on button clicks. RaIIMatButtons is the unique list of buttons for the Ra + matrix element page. Every element loads in the same Intro_to_excel_formatting, Excel_to_main_formatting, and End_formatting files, but has their own MatButtons txt file. If a user wishes to change the way the matrix elements pages look, they should change one of these files (excluding the MatButtons file). Any change in one of these files will affect the matrix elements HTML pages for every element, and may require changes in the string substitution section of TransitionManualInput.py. See code explanations for more detail. -TransitionRates (\"Format_csvs/TranstionRates\") This houses the formatting for the transition rates HTML pages. Transition rates pages are saved in the format FrTranAuto.html, BeIITranAuto.html. There are five necessary files for a single element's transtition rate styling. These files are (Using Be as example): Intro_to_life_formatting.txt Life_to_excel_formatting.txt Excel_to_main_formatting.txt End_formatting.txt BeIIButtonList.txt This follows the same format and guidelines as MatrixEle files. Life_to_excel_formatting controls the styling between the lifetime data table and the data table downloaded after clicking \"excel\". Excel_to_main_formatting controls the styling in-between the data table that is downloaded on the \"excel\" button click and the data table that is shown on the portal. The ButtonList needed for an element on its transition rates page is different than the button list needed for its matrix elements page, so a different txt file is necessary. If a user wishes to change the way the transition rate pages look, they should change one of these files (excluding the ButtonList file). Any change in one of these files will affect the transition rates HTML pages for every element, and may require changes in the string substitution section of TransitionManualInput.py. See code explanations for more detail. There is a sub-folder in this folder that houses the styling files for the \"all\" page of transition rates. The \"all\" page is the HTML file that is displayed when a user clicks on the \"all\" button for some element's transition rates. This page has its own unique styling and is stored in its own folder. Folders used: All_states -All_states (\"Format_csvs/TransitionRates/All_states\") This houses the formatting for the pages that display all transition rates of an element at once. These pages are saved in the format BeIITranFull.html, LiTranFull.html. There are two necessary files for this styling, listed below. There are no element-unique files for the \"all\" states since no button list is used. Files necessary are: Intro_to_table_formatting.txt End_formatting.txt These files follow the same usage as in the transition rate and matrix element pages. -OtherData (\"TransitionRates/OtherData\") This houses the formatting for the other data HTML page for an element. These pages are saved in the form NaOther.html, CaIIOther.html. There are more styling files in this folder due to the increased number of data tables. There is required formatting between the end of any one data table and the beginning of another. There are no styling files that are unique for an element- all elements share the same files. Necessary files are: Intro_to_nuclear.txt Nuclear_to_hyperfine.txt Hyperfine_to_metastable1.txt Hyperfine_to_metastableNoExp.txt Metastable1_to_2.txt End_formatting.txt Intro_to_nuclear and End_formatting follow the same style as for matrix element and transition rate pages. Nuclear_to_hyperfine has the styling between the nuclear data and the hyperfine constants A data. Hyperfine_to_metastable1 has the styling between the hyperfine data and the metastable data table with columns \"State, Property, Theory, Experiment\". Metastable1_to_2 has the styling between the metastable table listed above and the metastable table with columns \"Initial, Final, Transition, Wavelength, Matrix element, Units, Transition rate, Branching ratio\". Hyperfine_to_metastableNoExp is used in place of Hyperfine_to_metastable1 only when an element does not have a second metastable data table. ElementsHTMLS This is the folder where all the HTML files are saved to. There are saved in the format (using \"Fr\" as an example): Fr.html FrTranAuto.html FrTranFull.html FrOther.html X.html is the matrix element page, where X is the element. XTranAuto.html is the transition rate page with buttons for sorting which transitions are shown (the main transition rate page). XTranFull.html is the transition rate page displayed when a user clicks the \"all\" button on a main transition rate page. XOther.html is the other data page. Ions are saved in the format, using Ca + as an example, of: CaII.html, CaIITranAuto, etc. Experimental_Data Files, using \"Ca\" as example: Ca+-lifetimes.csv Ca+-matrix-elements.csv Key-File.csv Key file contains references with key and DOI. Need to have lifetimes and matrix element file for every element with experimental values. OtherData Files, using \"Ba\" as example: Metastable_elements.txt Metastable_key.xlsx KEY-hyperfine.xlsx Nuclear-data.xlsx BaII_Metastable_csv.csv Ba+_hyperfine.xlsx Metastable_elements is a manually generated txt file with a list of elements with metastable properties. Metastable key has references, keys, and DOIs.Key-hyperfine has references, keys, DOIs. Metastable_csv files were manually created: opened original metastable .xlsx file, saved the different elements in that excel file to their own csv file. Future versions could potentially have excel not joined together at creation, removing need for this. Ion hyperfine files have '+' format instead of 'II' format. One element change vs All elements change (not a folder) The following pages are specific to a single element. Changes to these files will only affect the HTML for that specific element. All files relating to data (Data, Experimental_Data, OtherData) Element specific button lists in Format_csvs-TransitionRates, MatrixEle The following pages are used for every page or every page of a specific type. Any change to one of them will affect every HTML page of that type. Format_csvs-all other stylings. This would depend on where the change is being made but any of the Intro, mid-table, or End formatting could change and affect all pages.

Excel_to_main_formatting controls the styling in-between the data table that is downloaded on the \"excel\" button click and the data table that is shown on the portal. The ButtonList needed for an element on its transition rates page is different than the button list needed for its matrix elements page, so a different txt file is necessary. If a user wishes to change the way the transition rate pages look, they should change one of these files (excluding the ButtonList file). Any change in one of these files will affect the transition rates HTML pages for every element, and may require changes in the string substitution section of TransitionManualInput.py. See code explanations for more detail. There is a sub-folder in this folder that houses the styling files for the \"all\" page of transition rates. The \"all\" page is the HTML file that is displayed when a user clicks on the \"all\" button for some element's transition rates. This page has its own unique styling and is stored in its own folder.
