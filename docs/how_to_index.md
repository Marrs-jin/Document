# Documentation for creating index.html page
In the first version of the website, we wanted to provide four of the properties of 12 atoms and ions.
The design offered was to provide all those atoms and ions in Button format.
Based on the active headers displayed on top of the container holding the buttons, that are the provided properties, each button is directed to separate pages.
