# Steps to create a polarizability page
Using Na as an example:

1. All the text files that are used to create the graphs are in the TXT Files folder.
2. Create the .csv format of these files as in the CSV Files Folder.
3. Create the related zip files. These are the text files that would be downloaded when the user clicks on Download Data Button.
4. Provide the name of the generated .csv files in the related python scripts that have been provided in the Python Scripts folder so that as a result you can see the generated graphs. Bokeh library is used for creating these graphs.
5. When all the graphs are created make the required changes to the NaPolarizability.html webpage so that correct HTML files are loaded to the iframe section of the page with each click of the button.
