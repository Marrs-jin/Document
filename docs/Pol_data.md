## Subdirectories for data used
All data folders need to be in the same directory as the codes are. The folders at this level are:
<ul>
<li>TXT Files</li>
<li>CSV Files</li>
<li>HTML Files</li>
<li>Python Scripts</li>
<li>Zip Files</li>
</ul>

**TXT Files** have all the text files that are used to create the graphs

**CSV Files** has the HTML stylings for the pages.

**HTML Files** has the final HTML files to be shown on the portal.

**Python Scripts** has the scripts used in generating the polarizability pages.
