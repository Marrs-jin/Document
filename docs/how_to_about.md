# Documentation for creating about.html page
This page has been designed for the purpose of giving more information about the project. We have talked about how data is calculated, all the formulas that have been used, and all related research papers.
In order to show all the topics that the user can read about on one page, we have used collapsible buttons. Clicking on the button expands it to show information on that topic.
To add more topics to this help page, just add another collapsible button to the page and add content under it.  
For the formulas, **Mathjax** library is used, and all formulas are in **Latex** format.
Put formulas in brackets if you want it to show on one separate line: **\\[formula \\]**. In order to put the formula on the same line with other contents just use parentheses around it, **\\(formula \\)**.
