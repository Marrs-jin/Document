# Documentation for creating feedback.html page
Feedback form was designed with the goal to get the feedback from the user regarding each page.
At this point we take General inquiries, and also feedback on different categories of web pages on the website.
 It can be the home page, Matrix Elements page,Transition rates, polarizabilities, or Other data.

We also have included a category called "other" for those questions that might not fit to any of these categories.
This is a google form, accessible through this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13IeRtnMmnKLYBJ8fQrj0HCDHgRuFqbQXDHR9cjNtIm0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">link</a>, and everyone involved in the project can edit it.
Easily share the link to this google form on the webpage so that users can view it.
